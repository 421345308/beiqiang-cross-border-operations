# Upgrade Remotion

1. Inspect the project manifests and lockfile to identify the package manager and workspaces. Preserve unrelated changes.
2. Determine whether `@remotion/cli` is locally available. If it is, run:

   ```bash
   npx remotion upgrade
   ```

   This may also update project-local Remotion skills. Inspect the resulting skill diff: this workspace maintains one `remotion-best-practices` entry with mode references. Preserve that structure and any newer guidance instead of adding parallel skill copies.

3. If `@remotion/cli` is not available, upgrade manually:
   - Get the latest stable Remotion version with `npm view remotion version`.
   - Find every installed `remotion` and `@remotion/*` dependency across the project and upgrade them all to that exact version. Preserve their dependency sections and the project's workspace or catalog conventions.
   - Read the current [Mediabunny compatibility page](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/mediabunny/version) and determine the Mediabunny version compatible with the target Remotion version. Upgrade every installed `mediabunny` and `@mediabunny/*` package to the documented compatible version.
   - Run the project's package manager to update its lockfile.
4. Update skill guidance only when the requested upgrade requires it. Compare the upstream source with this bundle, retain one project entry and validate every relative reference after merging. Plugin-managed and personal installations are separate scopes; do not update them as a side effect of a project package upgrade.

5. Review the manifest and lockfile diff. Ensure all Remotion packages use one version and all installed Mediabunny packages use the compatible version. If the CLI is available, run `npx remotion versions` as an additional check.

The [Remotion releases](https://github.com/remotion-dev/remotion/releases) contain the changelog and may be useful for summarizing relevant changes after the upgrade.
